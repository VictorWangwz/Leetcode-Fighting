## BFS Practices

###BFS in Binary Trees

1. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
2. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree <br>
2.1. BFS serializer (Time Limited Exception for leetcode but pass for LintCode) <br>
2.2. Preorder serializer (May not Unique?)
3. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal : Bottom up
4. Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal


###BFS in Graphs
1. Check whether a graph is a tree
2. Build Graph with node number and edges
3. Clone Graph
4. Get the Topological Order of DAG
5. 207 Course Schedule
6. 210 Course Schedule II
